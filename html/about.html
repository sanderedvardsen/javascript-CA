        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>At Rainy Days, we believe that exploring the world shouldnâ€™t stop when the weather changes.
            Our mission is to create high-quality, stylish, and functional outerwear that allows you to embrace
            every kind of weather.
            With a focus on innovation and comfort, our products are designed to push the boundaries of traditional
            rainwear, keeping you dry, protected, and confident no matter where your journey takes you.
            Whether you're navigating city streets or hiking through rugged landscapes, we have you covered.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our slogan, "Pushing the Comfort Zone," reflects our commitment to both performance and style.
            We challenge ourselves to design rainwear that not only keeps you comfortable but also inspires you to
            step outside your comfort zone and experience life in all weather conditions.
            Every piece of outerwear we create is built to last, combining durable materials, smart features, and
            modern design to help you stay comfortable, dry, and prepared for the unpredictable.
